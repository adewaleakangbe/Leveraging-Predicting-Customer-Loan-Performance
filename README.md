Financial companies encounter the difficulty of reducing loan defaults while providing credit
to qualified customers. The dataset contains diverse customer attributes, including account
type, credit term, payment history, and additional factors, accompanied by a binary target
label denoting loan performance (good = 0, poor = 1). The objective is to precisely forecast
this label to improve the institution's decision-making process.
